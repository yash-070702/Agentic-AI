Week 1: Python + Programming Foundations (Agentic AI Prep)

🎯 Goal of Week 1
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

Think logically in code

Write clean Python scripts

Understand how programs execute (critical for agents)

Be comfortable enough to move into AI & LLM concepts

⚠️ Agentic AI = 70% thinking + 30% tools
Python is the language of thinking here

📅 Daily Breakdown (7 Days)
🟢 Day 1: Python Setup + Programming Mindset
What you must do

Install Python (3.10+)

Install a code editor

Run your first Python program

Topics

What is Python & why AI uses Python

Python vs other languages

Interpreter vs Compiler

Writing & running .py files

Tools to install

Python

Visual Studio Code

Practice
print("Hello Agentic AI")
print(5 + 3)


🎯 Outcome:
You should feel comfortable running Python locally.

🟢 Day 2: Variables, Data Types & Input
Topics

Variables

Data Types:

int

float

string

boolean

type()

User input (input())

Why this matters for Agents

Agents constantly:

Store memory

Track state

Pass variables between tools

Example
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")


🎯 Outcome:
You understand how data flows inside a program.

🟢 Day 3: Conditions (Decision Making)
Topics

if, elif, else

Comparison operators

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Agent relevance

Agents decide actions based on conditions — this is the backbone.
